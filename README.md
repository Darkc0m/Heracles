# Heracles
Heracles is a CLI tool created to translate the **text** files from the game `Glory of Heracles` for the `Nintendo DS`. <br />The tool returns the text of the game in the `.po` format which can be recognized by a great ammount of CAT tools, such as: [Weblate](https://weblate.org/es/), [POEdit](https://poedit.net/), [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/), etc. <br />
This tool has been tested against the files of the `USA` version of the game and it is unknown if it works with the original `JP` release of the game.
